## Features

### BUILD A BACK-END WITH NODE/EXPRESS.JS

### Challenge Project: Quote API

#### Overview

npm install to add all dependencies

*command: node server.js*

*using node* 

This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

Project Goals
In this project, you’ll be building a small Express.js web API to store and serve different quotes about computers, coding, and technology.

Setup Instructions
If you choose to do this project on your computer instead of Codecademy, you can download what you’ll need by clicking the “Download” button below. You’ll need to open and work in server.js in a text editor. To edit server.js, use your text editor of choice. If you need a recommendation or help to install an editor, we recommend looking into our article about setting up a text editor for web development (Follow along until you get to the section: “Practice: Let’s Make a Project”). To run your API on your computer, you will need to install Node.js. If you need help installing Node.js, read our article on installing Node.

If you’d like to extend your app, here are some ideas to try, but you can also try out your own:

Add a PUT route for updating quotes in the data. This might require adding some sort of unique ID for each quote in the array in data.js.
Add a DELETE route for deleting quotes from the data array. As with PUT, this might require adding IDs to the data array and using req.params. For both of these ideas, you’ll be able to interact via Postman.
Add other data to the array, such as the year of each quote, and try to display it on the front-end.
Add another resource to your API in addition to quotes, such as biographical blurbs (you’ll need to find your own data for this new resource). Use Express Routers to keep your code simple and separated into different files for each router.
For most of these ideas, you might need to look into the front-end code in the public/ folder. If you’re not as familiar with front-end JavaScript, try our Build Interactive JavaScript Websites course and the Requests section of our Introduction to JavaScript course.
